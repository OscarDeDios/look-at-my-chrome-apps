# Look At My Chrome Apps!

Share the love about chrome apps & extension with your friends, co-workers, ...

## Screenshot
If you are a Chrome developper, fork the project and install the extension from chrome://extensions . 

If by chance it works, you could see this popup

![poup](_screenshots/00%20-%20LookAtMyChromeApps%202014-07-10.png)

Nothing else currently works.

## Mockups

Main popup
![title](_screenshots/01%20-%20Look%20At%20My%20Chrome%20Apps!.png)

Once you pasted it as Text (markdown)
 ![title](_screenshots/02%20-%20Export%20as%20Text%20(Markdown).png) 
 
 This is how you manage a list

 You can then edit it with a markdow-aware tool like Byword
